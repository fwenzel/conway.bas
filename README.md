# Conway's Game of Life in QBASIC

May 1, 2014 was the 50th birthday of the [BASIC programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC). What better day to get back to the roots and write a little BASIC code?

This is what it looks like:

## Running it yourself

Using

* [DOSBox](http://www.dosbox.com/) and
* [Microsoft QBASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic)

you can run the program yourself, right from QBasic.

If it's not running fast enough, you can adjust DOSBox's CPU emulation to run faster (I wish I has that luxury when I was a kid with a computer running MS-DOS!)
